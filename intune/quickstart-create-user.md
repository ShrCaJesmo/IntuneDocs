# Quickstart: Create a user in Intune and assign them a license

In this quickstart, you'll create a user and then assign them an Intune license. When using Intune, each person you want to have access to company data must have their own user account. Intune admins can configure users later to manage access control.

If you donâ€™t have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Sign in to Intune

Sign in to [Intune](https://aka.ms/intuneportal) as a [Global administrator or an Intune Service administrator](users-add.md#types-of-administrators). If you've created an Intune Trial subscription, the account you created the subscription with is the Global administrator.

## Create a user

Users must have a user account to enroll in Intune device management. To create a new user:

1. In Intune, choose **Users** > **All users** > **New user**.
![Browser](media/quickstart-create-user/create-user.png)
2. In the **Name** box enter a name, such as *Dewey Kellum*.
3. In the **User name** box enter a user identifier, such as Dewey@contoso.onmicrosoft.com.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you haven't configured your customer domain name, use the verified domain name you used to create the Intune subscription (or [free trial](free-trial-sign-up.md#sign-up-for-a-microsoft-intune-free-trial)). 

4. Choose **Show password** and make a note of the automatically generated password so that you can sign in to a test device.
5. Choose **Create**.

## Assign a license to the user

After you've created a user, you must use the [Microsoft 365 admin center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854) to assign an Intune license to them. If you don't assign the user a license, they'll be unable to enroll their device into Intune. 

To assign an Intune license to a user:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854) with the same credentials you used to sign in to Intune.
2. Choose **Users** > **Active Users** > and choose the user you just created.
3. Next to **Product licenses** select **Edit**.
4. Under **Location**, choose a location for the user.
5. Click **On** next to the Intune license (or another license that you've that includes Intune). The displayed [product name](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-service-plan-reference)** is used as the service plan in the Azure management 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This setting uses one of your licenses for this user. If you are using a trial environment, you would later reassign this license to a real user in a live environment.
6. Choose **Save** > **Close**.

The new active Intune user will now show that they're using an **Intune** license.

## Clean up resources

If you don't need this user anymore, you can delete the user by navigating to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854) and choose **Users** > **Active users** > *choose the user in the list* > **Delete user** > **Delete user** > **Confirm changes** > **Close**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a user and assigned an Intune license to them. For more information about adding users to Intune, see [Add users and grant administrative permission to Intune](users-add.md).
