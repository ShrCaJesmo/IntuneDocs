# Assign user and device profiles in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

You create a profile, and it includes all the settings you entered. The next step is to deploy or "assign" the profile to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user or device groups. When it's assigned, the users and devices receive your profile, and the settings you entered are applied.

This article shows you how to assign a profile, and includes some information on using scope tags on your profiles.

## Assign a device profile

1. Sign in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973).
2. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles**. All the profiles are listed.
3. Select the profile you want to assign > **Assignments**.
4. Choose to **Include** groups or **Exclude** groups, and then select your groups. When you select your groups, you're choosing an Azure AD group. To select multiple groups, hold down the **Ctrl** key, and select your groups.

5. **Save** your changes.

### Evaluate how many users are targeted

When you assign the profile, you can also **Evaluate** how many users are affected. This feature calculates users; it doesn't calculate devices.

1. In Intune, select **Device configuration** > **Profiles**.
2. Select a profile > **Assignments** > **Evaluate**. A message shows you how many users are targeted by this profile.

If the **Evaluate** button is grayed out, make sure the profile is assigned to one or more groups.

## Use scope tags or applicability rules

When you create or update a profile, you can also add scope tags and applicability rules to the profile.

**Scope tags** are a great way to assign and filter policies to specific groups, such as Human Resources or All US-NC employees. [Use RBAC and scope tags for distributed IT](scope-tags.md) has more information.

On Windows 10 devices, you can add **applicability rules** so the profile only applies to a specific OS version or a specific Windows edition. [Applicability rules](device-profile-create.md#applicability-rules) has more information.

## Exclude groups from a profile assignment

Intune device configuration profiles let you exclude groups from policy assignment.

Intune doesn't look at user-to-device group relationships. Including user groups while excluding device groups may not get the results you expect. In user group-to-user group and device group-to-device group scenarios, exclusion takes precedence over inclusion.

For example, you assign a device profile to the **All corporate users** user group, but exclude members in the **Senior Management Staff** user group. Since both groups are user groups, all members of the **Senior Management Staff** are excluded from the policy, even though they're members of the **All corporate users** include group.

Inclusion takes precedence over exclusion when using mixed groups, such as user group-to-device group, or device group-to-user group.

For example, you want to assign a device profile to all users in your organization, except kiosk devices. You include the **All Users** group, but exclude the **All Devices** group. In this case, all your users and their devices get the policy, even if the userâ€™s device is in the **All Devices** group.

Exclusion only looks at the direct members of the group. It doesn't include devices that are associated with a user. However, devices that don't have a user, don't get the policy. This behavior happens because devices without users have no relationship to the **All Users** group.

If you include **All Devices**, and exclude **All Users**, then all the devices receive the policy. In this scenario, the intent is to exclude devices that have an associated user from this policy. However, it doesn't exclude the devices because the exclusion only compares direct group members.

## Next steps

See [monitor device profiles](device-profile-monitor.md) for guidance on monitoring your profiles, and the devices running your profiles.
